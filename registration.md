# 2020 Camp Canceled 

It is with regret that we have announce that due to the COVID-19 situation and the difficulties of complying with Provincial and City of Toronto regulations our 2020 Summer Program has been canceled.  Our race program will continue in a modified form but all learn to sail sessions are canceled.

We apologize for the inconvenience to those who were looking forward to sailing this year but we will be back in 2021.
