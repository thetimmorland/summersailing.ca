# Oppi

The Oppi is a simpler, more robust version, of the classic learn to sail Optimist dinghy.
 
With a plastic hull the boat is almost indestructible making it perfect for beginner sailors who sometimes find collisions hard to avoid.

# RS Feva

The RS Feva has three sails.  A mylar main, dacron jib and an asymmetric gennaker for a total sail area of 163 sq ft .  The hull is made of rotomolded plastic making it extremely durable and hard to damage.  The self-baling open transom makes recovery from a capsize quick and easy.  It is an international youth class for under 17s.

In a configuration with a smaller sail area we use the RS Feva to introduce our CANSail2 “learn to sail” sailors to two handed sailing. In the full rig, three sail configuration the same boat is used by some of our two-handed racers.

# Optimist

Optimist sailboats are designed especially for children, with a broad beam for exceptional safety and stability.   Sailed in over 100 countries by over 150,000 young people, it is the only dinghy approved by the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) exclusively for sailors under 16 years of age.  Optimist dinghies are what our youngest “learn to race” sailors use to develop their skills.

# Club 420

The Club 420 also has three sails.  Dacron main and jib together with a symmetrical spinnaker for a total sail area of 180 sq ft.  The 420 has the added interest of a trapeze for the crew. It is a class that is very actively raced in North America with start lines of up to 80 boats in local Lake Ontario regattas.  A typical 420 sailor is 12 years of age and upward.

# Laser Radial / Full Rig

The Laser is a single-handed boat that is raced internationally and is an extremely competitive class.  There are two commonly raced rigs for the laser.  “Full-Rig” has a larger sail area of 76 sq ft and “Radial” with a smaller sail area of 61 sq ft.  It is the Radial that is more commonly sailed by smaller lighter sailors.  Advanced sailors in our racing team who prefer to continue racing single handed sail the Laser Radial.
