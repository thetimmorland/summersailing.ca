# August 21 & 22 2018

Hans Fogh was a one of the most successful competitive sailors in history, with dozens of national and international championships and in many different classes, including two Olympic medals. He was a big supporter of youth sailing and we are pleased to name our regatta after him.

The aim of the regatta which is held annually in August,  is to provide an opportunity for budding two-handed racers to take part in a friendly, introductory, competition.  The event is open to members of sailing schools and clubs who are under the age of 18.  There are four classes; Club 420 white sail and spinnaker, RS Feva XL and RS Feva S.  As in Previous years Thomas Fogh has agreed to volunteer his time as guest coach.  Thomas will be coaching the back half of the fleets to ensure everyone gets the maximum from their time on the water.  We are also lucky enough to have international race officer Irene McNeill as principal race officer for the second year running.

We strive to keep this event one of the most affordable in the youth racing calendar, this is only possible with the help of all the people who give freely of their time at no cost.  If you are willing to volunteer or help in any way to make our 2018 regatta even more successful than last year, please send us an email telling us how you may be able to help.

There are generally few opportunities to race RS Fevas in Ontario and we are keen to support and grow this class.  Clubs with RS Fevas are particularly welcome to race with us.
