Victoria started sailing as a 10 year-old at summer camp. She fell in love with the sport and continued to learn, sailing Optimists, Laser Picos, CL 14s, and Club 420s, before moving on to try her hand at sailing keelboats of all sizes, including J/24s and a Niagara 35.  She has taught several learn-to-sail programs and curriculums, on each of these boats and more, over the past six years.  Returning to our team for the second year, she is excited to bring her coaching experience to EYC as the Head Instructor for the 2018 season!
Having just graduated from Humber College with a Bachelor of Music, Victoria is a working musician and educator throughout the year, and is working on releasing her debut EP this year.

Returning to the EYC coaching staff in 2018 as the Laser Race Team coach, Andrzej first started sailing in our learn to sail program 7 years ago. He raced in the 420 class for two years before moving on to sail two more years in the laser class posting many podium finishes. Sailing is a big part of Andrzej’s life, his family owns a keelboat which they keep at EYC and he is always crewing on larger keelboats for regattas and weeknight racing at EYC. 
Andrzej is currently studying a double degree in Business Administration at the Wilfrid Laurier University, and Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, he is also one of the few members on our staff who can rival Tim for number of hats lost in Lake Ontario. 
Andrzej is excited to take on the challenge of the Laser Coach position to guide the next generation of Laser sailors to continue EYC’s reputation as a leading club  in the Laser class!

## Tim Morland
# Optimist Race Coach
![Tim](/assets/our-team/2018Tim.jpg)

Tim started sailing in the EYC Junior Sail Program when he was seven years old.  Initially sailing was just “something to do” for a couple of weeks each summer but somewhere along the line somebody suggested he should try racing, at which point things took off.  He sailed for four weeks the next year, then eight weeks, then the whole season from May to November.  As well as sailing in Ontario, Tim has also travelled to Florida for training and Germany for an international regatta.  He has raced in an Optimist, RS Feva, Club 420 and Laser Radial, competing at numerous dinghy regattas over the last six years.  As well as racing dinghies, Tim is an active participant in the EYC keel boat racing scene as crew on “Still Knot Working” and “Rum Kist”.
Over the years Tim has lost countless hats and pairs of sunglasses in Lake Ontario.
When Tim is not sailing, he is studying for a career in engineering and technology.
2018 is Tim’s first year as our Optimist Race Team Coach.  He is looking forward to passing on what he has learned from his own racing career to the next generation of racers.

## Sean Wylie

Sean has been around sailboats all of his life, from cruising in Georgian Bay to chartering in the North Channel.  Despite this it was not until Sean was a teenager when one of his friends convinced him to sign up for sailing camp at EYC.  After two years in the learn to sail program sailing RS Fevas and Club 420s, Sean made the decision to join the laser race team.  On the race team Sean trained in Florida and attended regattas all across southern Ontario.  It was during that season where he was also introduced to weeknight keelboat racing.  Sean now races in the MCC and EYC weeknight race series’ on “Rum Kist” and “Still Knot Working” alongside some of the other EYC coaches. 
When Sean is not at EYC, he is racing Collegiate 420s for the University of Ottawa and studying Mechanical Engineering. 
After a great season coaching CANSail 2, Sean is excited to help sailors in CANSail 3/4 grow their sailing skills and have an amazing summer.

## Deanne Balas
# CANSail 1/2 Instructor
![Deanne](/assets/our-team/2018Deanne.jpg)

Deanne was introduced to sailing at a young age through trips on her family keel boat in Lake Champlain.  She started a Learn to Sail program at age 8 and loved sailing around the harbour in her own boat.  Later on in her sailing adventures she was introduced to racing.  This brought on a whole new side of sailing that she never knew about, tactics and strategy.  She has raced in RS Fevas, Club 420s, Lasers, and keel boats.  While on the race team she formed a new family with people that loved the sport as much as her and would spend hours on the water together.  A number of the people from that racing family are also instructors at EYC.
Deanne is currently in her second year at Dalhousie University in Neuroscience. This will be her second year as a CANSail 1/2 instructor and she is so excited to see new and old faces this summer.

She became interested in racing and joined EYC’s Laser race team where she sailed for 2 years and competed in many regattas.  While on EYC’s race team, Mélodie had the opportunity to further develop her sailing skills and ability, and gained confidence on the water. 
Mélodie spends her weekends at Mimico Cruising Club on her family’s keel boat. 
In addition to her love of sailing, she is a lifeguard and an avid snowboarder and is fluent in French.
She looks forward to sharing her love of sailing with younger sailors this summer!

Michael learned to sail during summers spent in St. Margaret’s Bay, Nova Scotia. He began sailing at the age of 8 in an Optimist, when he joined the St. Margaret’s Bay Sailing Club Junior Sail program.  At SMSC, Michael learned the discipline needed for sailing, while also having fun thanks to his fantastic coaches.  Although most of his sailing experience comes from time spent on the East Coast, he has also built on his skills in programs run out of Georgian Bay, Kempenfelt Bay, and Lake Ontario.
Michael has competed in regattas and races around Nova Scotia and Ontario, including the National C420 Championships in 2016.  He has raced in an Optimist and Club 420s.  Last year he was a member of the SMSC Club 420 Race Team, where he competed against teams from Canada and the US.
In addition to sailing, Michael enjoys snowboarding, photography, and other water sports. He is looking forward to his role as CANSail 1/2 Instructor, and passing on his love of sailing to the students at EYC.
