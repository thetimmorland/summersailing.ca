## Victoria Shalygan
# Head Instructor
![Victoria](/assets/our-team/2019Victoria.jpg)

Victoria started sailing as a 10 year-old at summer camp. She fell in love with the sport and continued to learn, sailing Optimists, Laser Picos, CL 14s, and Club 420s, before moving on to try her hand at sailing keelboats of all sizes, including J/24s and a Niagara 35.  She has taught several learn-to-sail programs and curriculums, on each of these boats and more, over the past seven years.  Returning to our team for the fourth year, she is excited to bring her coaching experience to EYC as the Head Instructor for the 2020 season!
Victoria is a working musician and educator throughout the year, and is working on releasing her debut EP this year.

## Hiring Now

The other members of our 2020 instructor team are in the process of being interviewed.  We are still accepting applications for the following positions.

# <a href="/assets/job-postings/2020-EYC-Optimist-Race-Coach.pdf">Optimist Race Coach</a>

We are looking for a dedicated and experienced coach for our growing Optimist Race Team.  The race team trains Monday to Friday for eight weeks in July and August, typically attending several local regattas during that period including Opti CORK in Kingston.  In addition we run pre and post season training on Sunday afternoons in May & June and September & October.  The goal of the team is to develop a sustained interest in racing in our younger sailors. We expect our coach to push the sailors when appropriate, but also to maintain a fun environment that keeps the sailors coming back for more.

# <a href="/assets/job-postings/2020-EYC-CANSail-3-4-Instructor.pdf">CANSail 3/4 Instructor</a>

We are looking for a dedicated and experienced CANSail 3/4 instructor.  This position is a key pillar of our learn to sail program developing the skills of young sailors most who have completed CANSail 1/2 levels in previous years.  CANSail 3/4 is taught using our C-420s, or in some cases RS Fevas.  Sailors in CANSail 3/4 typically sail for 4 weeks and compete in one local regatta.  The CANSail 3/4 instructor plays an important part in identifying candidates to join our racing teams.  Our core program runs for eight weeks in July and August.  Instructors work an additional week at the start and end of the season for set up and close down of the program.
