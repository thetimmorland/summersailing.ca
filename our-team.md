![Iain](/assets/our-team/iain.jpg)

I got into sailing at the age of 5 when I went sailing with my aunt for the first time.  It was love at first sail and I have been hooked ever since.  I got quite serious over the last 3 years, racing 420s on the Ontario Sailing Team, competing at many national and international events.  I have just finished my first year at Queen’s University study computer engineering.   I hope to continue sailing throughout my time at Queen’s on the university team.  When I’m not on the water or studying in the library, I like to spend my time playing guitar and cooking.

He first started racing in the 420 class for two years before moving on to sail two more years in the laser class posting many podium finishes. Sailing is a big part of Andrzej’s life, his family owns a keelboat they keep at EYC and hes always crewing on larger keelboats for regattas and weeknight racing at EYC. He is studying a double degree in computer science at University of Waterloo as well as in business administration at Wilfred Laurier University through their joint degree program. Andrzej is excited to begin coaching this summer and helping the new generation of sailors realize the same love for sailing he has.
