The Etobicoke Yacht Club (EYC) established the Junior Sail Program to promote the sport of sailing for the youth of our community. The Program, has been operating for almost fifteen years and is conducted in a dedicated sail training facility at the Etobicoke Yacht Club and on the water in the beautiful, sheltered Humber Bay.

All coaches are nationally certified and insured by Sail Canada. We deliver their nationally accredited CANsail curriculum. Our staff all share a love for the development of Sailing.

The Program is open to youth between the ages of 7 to 17, who want to have fun and experience the thrill and enjoyment of sailing!
