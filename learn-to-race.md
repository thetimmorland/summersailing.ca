Our learn to race program is for the more experienced and enthusiastic sailors.  Things are a little more serious than in the learn to sail program.  Although the sailors still have a great deal of fun they are training to compete in local regattas and are aiming to win honours for themselves and the club.  Our learn to race sailors typically sail for the eight weeks of July and August and will enter regattas at other clubs in places such as Hamilton, Port Credit and Oakville.  Regattas are usually held at weekends and a level of parental involvement is needed to help with transporting boats to and from events.
 
Sailing all summer our race team members make strong friendships and become extremely skilled sailors.  It is our dream to one day see one of our sailors graduate to the Canadian Olympic team.
 
For those who want to race we have a few options for different boats depending on size, experience and if the sailor wants to race solo or two-handed.

# Optimist

The best way to introduce young sailors to racing is in the Optimist class.
 
To join the Optimist racing team a sailor should have passed at least CANSail 1 and be comfortable sailing in a variety of weather conditions. The only restriction on age is that the sailor should be under the age of 16 on 31st December of the year in which he or she is racing. Typically Optimists racers on Lake Ontario are between the ages of 10 and 14 and weigh between 65lbs and 120lbs. Light winds favour the lighter sailors, strong winds favour those who are heavier.

# Laser

For more experienced sailors who want to continue with single-handed racing the Laser is the boat of choice. The Laser is raced internationally and is an extremely competitive class. To join the Laser racing team a sailor should have passed at least CANSail 3. Typically Laser sailors are aged 13 and up, although younger sailors are seen on the racing circuit it is unusual. The optimal weight for sailing a Laser Radial is between 120lbs and 160lbs.
