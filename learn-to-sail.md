The emphasis of our learn to sail program is on fun.  Although we deliver the nationally accredited CANsail curriculum and take the sailing instruction seriously, we never forget that this is summer camp for the children taking part.
 
The children launch their boats from our gentle beach right inside the yacht club.  The younger, more inexperience sailors sail inside our sheltered bay.  More experienced sailors in the more advanced course sail further out into Lake Ontario.  With an eye for safety there are some days when the weather is not suitable for sailing.  On “no sail” days and after sailing our children enjoy a variety of games and other activities in our grounds.

# CANSail 2

Suitable for younger sailors who have passed CANSail 1, or for confident older children who are new to sailing. This course uses the highly rated RS Feva sailing dinghy in a double-handed configuration. As a guideline students should weigh in excess of 85lbs before sailing the Feva. The course is extremely popular and sells out quickly.

# CANSail 3 / CANSail 4

This is a double-handed course for sailors who have passed CANSail 2 and are ready to progress beyond the introductory levels. Usually the course is taught in the Club 420 and for safety it is recommended that students should weigh in excess of 100lbs before sailing this larger boat. For lighter sailors it may be possible to complete this session in an RS Feva. Although this course is offered in 2 week sessions, it is highly recommended that students enroll for a minimum of 4 weeks to allow sufficient time to develop the skills needed to pass the intermediate levels.

# CANSail 5 / CANSail 6

Although we offer CANSail 5 and CANSail 6 as learn to sail courses, by the time they have reached this standard most of our keen sailors have joined one of the race teams.  In the race teams they work on  attaining there sailing qualifications alongside training to race competitively.
